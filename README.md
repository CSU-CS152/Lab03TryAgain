# Lab03TryAgain
Loops and if warmup lab

Read the following code in the attached file and answer the questions about it:

1. How does onlyOneRightAnswer work?

2. How many times does notAFactorial(9) loop?

3. There are two things wrong with notAFactorial. What should we change about it to make it properly produce a factorial?

4. How could we edit askForInput() to make it loop forever? (there are multiple correct answers)

5. How long does the actual while loop for notAFactorial run, when ignoring what happens inside of it? (how long does while(num == num) run?

6. Your turn. Write magic8(num) so that it uses num to predict an outcome. It must follow the following rules and return the appropriate strings

If num is less than 23, return “ask again later”
If num is 41, return “all signs point to yes”
If num is less than or equal to 72, return “outlook not so good”
Otherwise, return “concentrate and ask again”

def magic8(num):




7. Add a while loop to main to prompt the user for another num to give to magic8 until the user enters -1
